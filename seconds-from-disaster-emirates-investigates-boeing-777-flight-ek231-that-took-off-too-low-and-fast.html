Crews shall not set airport elevation on the MCP after landing or shut down.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One theory is that the previous crew had set the ‘autopilot altitude target window’ to 0000 when they shut the aircraft down and that this put the ‘flight director’ into the wrong mode, ‘maintain selected altitude’, instead of TOGA (take-off/go-around).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Put simply, the ‘flight director’ is a cross that gives lateral and vertical guidance on the ‘Primary Flight Display’ (artificial horizon) screen&nbsp;in the cockpit – it indicates the pitch ‘attitude’ that the aircraft should be flown at. And in this instance, it’s possible that it was directing the crew to point the aircraft too low on take-off and not at the correct 12 to 15 per cent angle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The flight director doesn’t control the aircraft, it’s a guide, and the autopilot in a 777 doesn’t kick in until at least 200ft in altitude, so as the plane is going down the runway, the pilots are in full manual control.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, it could be, the Boeing captain said, that the pilots became distracted by the unusual computer indications.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: ‘The flight director bar should indicate the target pitch attitude for take-off and it is up to the pilot to rotate the aircraft up to this attitude to climb away at a safe speed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘”Rotate” is called by the monitoring pilot – the one not with hands on the controls – and the handling pilot then pulls back on the control column to rotate the aircraft to the take-off pitch attitude.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If he/she doesn’t call “rotate”, then the handling pilot should do it anyway as they should be monitoring aircraft speed during the take-off roll [the correct take-off speed is worked out beforehand depending on the aircraft’s weight and weather conditions]. My guess here is that the monitoring pilot was confused by the strange appearance of the flight director – again I’m guessing here that it was in ALT mode not TOGA – and “tunnelled in” on that distraction, missing the necessary call of “rotate”. ‘</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/11/53724031-10472115-image-a-15_1643886372031.jpg decoding=async id=i-eb1d03caee4923ef height=423 width=634 alt="There is speculation that an incorrect ¿target¿ post-take-off altitude had been inputted into the plane¿s mode control panel (stock image above) before take-off" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center title="Seconds from disaster: Emirates investigates Boeing 777 flight EK231 that took off too low and fast 11"><p></p><p class=imageCaption>There is speculation that an incorrect ‘target’ post-take-off altitude had been inputted into the plane’s mode control panel (stock image above) before take-off</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/11/53719349-10472115-image-a-19_1643886823524.jpg decoding=async id=i-c7cbd4c98f0799c2 height=438 width=634 alt="Seconds from disaster: Emirates investigates Boeing 777 flight EK231 that took off too low and fast 3" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center title="Seconds from disaster: Emirates investigates Boeing 777 flight EK231 that took off too low and fast 13"><p></p><p class=imageCaption>&nbsp;</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/15/53734247-10472115-image-a-35_1643901367311.jpg decoding=async id=i-ca3254a334fa44c3 height=363 width=634 alt="TOP TABLE: This data from Flightradar24, published by Onemileatatime.com, shows how the December 20 flight was still on the ground at 216 knots (248mph).
