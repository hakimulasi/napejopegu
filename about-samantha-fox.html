In this article, you can find out what happened to the famous Page 3 model and where she is now.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most renowned pin-up girls in the early 80s, Samantha Fox, wowed everyone’s heart with her beauty and gorgeous figure. Those were the days when everyone gushed about how talented she was as a vocalist and <a href=#>model.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About Samantha Fox</h2><p>Even though she has had rock n roll adventures and painful memories throughout her life, she has always been tough enough to endure any circumstance. <strong>Are you wondering how old Samantha Fox in 2021 is?&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samantha-Fox-Now.jpg><p>Samantha Fox was born on April 15th, 1966, in Mile End, East London. As of 2021, she is 55 years old. Her full name is Samantha Karen Fox. Actress Carole Ann Wilken’s and John Patrick Fox’s eldest daughter, Sam Fox, descended from a family of market traders.&nbsp;</p><p>Samantha Fox has three siblings in total. One of her sisters is Vanessa, and two half-siblings, Frederica and Frankie, are from her father’s second marriage. She had a terrible past, as did all of her siblings, but she was the eldest. So she felt a greater sense of responsibility for them.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Creative Pursuits</h2><p>Sam was drawn to the arts and theatre at a very young age, making her first appearance on stage when she was only three years old. When she turned fourteen, she created her debut pop band with Richard Smart, Edward Gallagher, and Bob Day.&nbsp;</p><p>When recognition arrives, it brings with it its own set of drawbacks. She has been bullied since she was a child. In her early school days, she was gaining popularity. Samantha enrolled in Wood Green’s St. Thomas More Catholic School and, from the age of fifteen, the Anna Scher Theatre School.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Exceptional Career</h2><p>Samantha Fox started her career as a fashion model in her adulthood. When she was only 16, she debuted as a topless model on Page 3.</p><p>Page 3 was a British magazine, which published bold pictures of a topless female <a href=#>glamour model.</a></p><p>It was formerly a British newspaper custom to publish photographs of semi-nude models at that time. After her debut on Page 3 of the British tabloid daily The Sun in 1983, she remained a Page 3 girl until 1986.</p><p>During this period, Fox rose to prominence as the most popular pin-up girl of her generation and one of the most photographed British women of the 1980s. In 1986, the diva ended her career at age 20 as a topless model with Page 3 and began her musical journey.</p><p>Samantha Fox’s breakthrough debut song, <strong><a href=#>Touch Me (I Want Your Body)</a></strong>, reached number four in the US charts and number three in the UK charts. The song charted at number one in 17 countries, and she has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.</p><p>Everyone was taken aback by the fact that a topless glamour model has abilities beyond her appearance. Since then, Samantha has been a big star in the 1980s, with her singles including Naughty Girls and I Wanna Have Some Fun.</p><p>Fox was nominated for a Brit Award for Best British Female Artist in the year 1988 for her beautiful voice. Not only that, but Samantha had also worked as a television host on several occasions. Additionally, she has appeared in a lot of movies and tv series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Facing the Challenges and Harassment</h2><p>Samantha Fox made news in 1985 when she accused David Cassidy of molestation both during and after the video shooting for his single Romance. Not only that, but she had gone through a lot worse since she was a youngster.</p><p>In the past, Sam’s mom submitted many images of her daughter Fox wearing lingerie in the Girl of the Year amateur modeling competition, and she was unaware of it. The Sunday People newspaper sponsored it in 1983.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam Fox got second place out of 20,000 entries, and her pictures instantly caught the attention of The Sun, who requested her to appear on Page 3 of the newspaper. But she had no idea what was going to happen.</p><p>The photographer told her that having such ample bosoms and such petite hips was very rare for her age. During her shot as a competitor in the Sunday People contest, he remarked that she has an innocent child-like face and a woman’s body.&nbsp;</p><p>Because Samantha was only a 16-year-old girl who was naïve to all of this casual sexualization, it was such a humiliating remark for her. The photographer pushed her to perform a couple of topless photographs at the end of the shoot, saying that they wouldn’t be published.&nbsp;</p><p>Fox came in second place in the competition, but her naked breasts were featured on the front page of the Sunday People irrespective of the photographer’s claims. Her headteacher was not pleased, but Fox was approached by lads at school.</p><p>She was getting popular and was requested to sign autographs from the school guys. All of this was in striking comparison to the humiliation she had endured as a child when she was forced to wear calipers and a platform boot to address a hip ailment.</p><p>Even before she got famous for being a sexy model, she had been subjected to sexual harassment on a regular basis. Unknown boys often followed her way to the school from the bus, while her teachers sometimes made lewd comments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>As a Daughter of an Abusive Father</h2><p>Fox is making the discoveries when her debut autobiography, Forever, is released. She also said that following a violent, unprovoked attack in 1991, her father left her with scrapes, bruises, and two fractured ribs.</p><p>Pat, her errant father, seized charge of her <a href=#>business</a> activities as she grew into a multi-millionaire. However, he was suffering from an alcohol and cocaine addiction, which ended in his assaulting her in a horrific attack that left her laying in a pool of blood.&nbsp;</p><p>Samantha Fox had experienced much more adversity as a child. Eventually, Carole had been estranged from Fox’s father since 1988, when she had had enough of his alcoholism and violence. Throughout the ensuing years, his life got out of hand.</p><p>Sam regained financial control of her company after becoming an international music artist with singles such as the global blockbuster Touch Me.</p><p>Her father had not paid tax on her salary for several years and had conned millions of pounds, the majority of which had gone on drink and drugs, she discovered.</p><p>Notwithstanding this double violation and the fact that she seldom spoke to him until he died in 2000, she forgives him. She believes his actions were motivated by his addiction and traumatic background.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Samantha Coming Out as Gay</h2><p>Samantha stated in 2003 that she was seeing her manager, that later became her girlfriend, Myra Stratton. Sam, on the other hand, found long-term romance with Myra Stratton. But in 2015,&nbsp; Myra, unfortunately, lost her long-term fight with cancer.</p><p>Losing someone after the couple had been together for twelve years was hard. Samantha had endured all of the pain. She believed meeting Myra encouraged her to announce her sexuality in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite fears about what her male admirers would think. She subsequently revealed that she was afraid of losing admirers if she declared herself a lesbian.&nbsp; Fox fell in love again, this time more deeply.</p><p>In 2016, Samantha met her current companion Linda Olsen, who is 45 years old. After allowing herself to mourn the death of Myra, Samantha and Linda became a couple and are still together. Samantha is said to be engaged to Linda Olsson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Samantha Fox Net Worth</h2><p>Sam Fox has subsequently become a familiar figure on reality television, as seen by her 2016 appearance on Celebrity Big Brother. Her net worth is estimated to be $20 million, according to the relevant sources.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCtwaisrWWjlrqiutOhmGaen618</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-most-famous-celebrity-guest-stars-on-greys-anatomy.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Most Famous Celebrity Guest Stars On Grey's Anatomy</a>
