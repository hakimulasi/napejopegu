After winning the Heisman trophy as the quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners, Baker Mayfield was first overall draft pick of the Cleveland Browns in the 2018 NFL Draft. Upon joining the Browns in 2018, Baker received a $21.8 million signing bonus. Including that bonus, Baker made just under $50 million in his first six NFL seasons alone. Unfortunately, as we explain in the next section, Baker experienced a significant financial controversy in 2023.</p><h2 id=alleged-investment-loss><strong>Alleged Investment Loss</strong></h2><p>On August 19, 2023 it was revealed that Baker wad filed a petition a court in Austin, Texas to demand financial records from an investment firm, covering the years 2018 to 2023. The petition also demanded depositions from investment managers at six companies. Awkwardly, two of those companies were founded by Baker's father James Mayfield. In the petition Baker sought to uncover what happened to $12 million he invested with the firms. The petition said that Baker does not know "if their money has been properly and competently invested, has been stolen or otherwise misappropriated, or something in between."</p><p>During the years in question, 2018 to 2023, Baker grossed a little more than $50 million. After taxes and fees that would have been reduced down to $20 million. So if $12 million was truly stolen or lost inappropriately, that equates to 60% of his total net earnings.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-257567 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-926761666.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-257567 class=wp-caption-text>Joe Robbins/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Baker Reagan Mayfield was born on April 14, 1995, in Austin, Texas, to Gina and James Mayfield, the second of two sons. Baker played quarterback for the Lake Travis High School Cavaliers leading the team to a 25-2 record over two seasons and winning the 2011 4A State Championship. He finished his high school football career with 6,255 passing yards, 67 touchdowns, and eight interceptions and was a three-star recruit. He received a few scholarship offers but ended up walking-on at Texas Tech University.</p><p>In 2013, Baker Mayfield was named the starting quarterback for the Red Raiders becoming the first walk-on true freshman quarterback to start a FBS season opener. In his first start, Baker threw for 413 yards and four touchdowns and was named the Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Week. For the year, he amassed 2,315 passing yards and 12 touchdown passes but left the program citing a miscommunication with the coaching staff.</p><p>Baker Mayfield transferred to the University of Oklahoma and walked-on for the Sooners. He lost a year of eligibility due to Big 12 transfer rules, but the next season Baker won the starting job. For the 2015 season, Mayfield helped lead the Sooners to the Orange Bowl where they lost to Clemson 37-17. The next year, the Sooners won the Sugar Bowl 35-19 over Auburn with Mayfield earning the MVP award. And in 2017, Mayfield led Oklahoma to their third straight Big 12 championship beating the TCU Horned Frogs 41-17. But the Sooners lost in the 2018 Rose Bowl 54-48 to the Georgia Bulldogs in the national semifinal game.</p><p>Baker Mayfield won the 2017 Heisman Trophy receiving 732 first-place votes and a total of 2,398 points. He became the first walk-on player to ever win the prestigious award.</p><h2 id=cleveland-browns><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></h2><p>In the 2018 NFL Draft, Baker Mayfield was selected with the first overall pick held by the Cleveland Browns. He signed a four-year deal with the team worth $32.68 million in guaranteed salary. He made his first appearance of the season in Week 3 against the New York Jets stepping in for an injured <a href=# title="Tyrod Taylor Net Worth">Tyrod Taylor</a> and leading the team back from a 14-0 deficit to win the game 21-17. Baker took over the starting quarterback job from there grabbing the reins of a team that had gone 1-31 over the past two years, helping to lead them to a 7-8-1 record. His rookie campaign saw him break the record for touchdown passes thrown by a rookie, surpassing <a href=#>Peyton Manning</a> and <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a> with 27 despite not even playing the entire year.</p><p>Over the next few years, the Cleveland Browns went through several coaching and offensive coordinator changes. But Baker Mayfield had his best season in 2020 throwing for 4,030 yards, 30 touchdowns, and nine interceptions including a Wild Card Round playoff win over the Pittsburgh Steelers and Divisional Round loss against the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>The Browns exercised Mayfield's fifth-year contract option for the 2022 season worth $18.9 million guaranteed. But Baker played through a partially torn labrum in a down year in which the Browns missed the playoffs. The injury happened after Mayfield threw an interception and tried to make a tackle. He played through most of the season wearing a harness on his shoulder and later suffered a fractured humerus bone in that same shoulder. Mayfield sat out the season finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers and announced he would undergo surgery.</p><p>In the offseason, the Cleveland Browns traded for quarterback <a href=#>Deshaun Watson</a>, and Mayfield requested a trade. Baker Mayfield was traded to the Carolina Panthers on July 6, 2022, for a 2024 conditional fifth-round pick. He was released by the Panthers (at his request) in December 2022. He was then picked up by the LA Rams. In March 2023 he signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Bucs that gave him a salary of $1.25 million and a signing bonus of $2.875 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-277046 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Baker-Mayfield.jpg alt="Baker Mayfield Net Worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-277046 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=controversy><strong>Controversy</strong></h2><p>Mayfield was arrested on February 25, 2017, in Washington County, Arkansas, on charges of public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing and resisting arrest. Early that Saturday morning, a police officer was flagged down by someone on an assault and battery report. The police report described Baker as unable to walk in a straight line and having slurred speech. When he was asked to stay and give a statement, Mayfield began yelling and causing a scene. He tried running away but was tackled by an officer and booked on misdemeanor charges. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and was sentenced to complete 35 hours of community service and to take an alcohol education program.</p><h2 id=uber-driving><strong>Uber Driving</strong></h2><p>Baker Mayfield wasn't always a hotshot quarterback. After transferring to Oklahoma from Texas Tech, he wasn't guaranteed a starting job with the Sooners. While still trying to prove himself on the field, Mayfield spent some time working as an Uber driver.</p><p>In 2015 and 2016, Mayfield drove around Norman, giving his fellow Oklahomans rides. The average Uber driver gets about two rides per hour. Assuming Mayfield drove about 30 hours a week (and even that might be a high estimate), he made $590 a week.</p><p>One fan shared a screenshot of his experience riding with Mayfield. Let's just hope the quarterback's receivers run more precise routes than the one he took here:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tweet.jpg alt width=503 height=399 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Baker Mayfield married Emily Wilkinson in July of 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6e4jpuYpJ2iYrqixcWinKWcXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./brianna-do-parents-father-max-and-mother-phuong-do.html>&#171;&nbsp;Brianna Do Parents: Who Are Father Max And Mother Phuong Do?</a>
