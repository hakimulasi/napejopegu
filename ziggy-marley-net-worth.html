Surrounded by music as a child, he took guitar and drum lessons from his father and sat in on his father's recording sessions. With some of his classmates, Marley formed a singing group called the Seven Do Bees. He also played with his brother Stephen at some of their father's bigger concerts in the late 1970s.</p><h2 id=ziggy-marley-melody-makers><strong>Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers</strong></h2><p>In 1979, Marley and his siblings Stephen, Sharon, and Cedella founded the reggae band Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, named after the British weekly music magazine Melody Maker. They went on to make their recording debut with the song "Children Playing in the Streets," which was written for them by their father. Royalties from the single went to the United Nations. The Melody Makers released their debut album, "Play the Game Right," in 1985. That was followed by "Hey World!" in 1986. The group's commercial breakthrough came in 1988 with the album "Conscious Party," which launched the popular songs "Tumblin' Down" and "Tomorrow People" and won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Recording.

Further nominations came in the 1990s for "Jahmekya," "Joy and Blues," and "Free Like We Want 2 B," followed by a Grammy win in 1997 for "Fallen is Babylon."
