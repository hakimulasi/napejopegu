Macaulay Culkin became a household name after starring in a string of early smash-hit films in the 1990s, most notably "Home Alone," "Home Alone 2: Lost In New York," "My Girl," "Richie Rich," "Uncle Buck," and "The Good Son."</p><p>At the peak of his career, Culkin was one of the highest paid and most powerful actors, child or adult, in the entire movie business. We detail his salaries for his most significant films in the next section below.</p><p>Culkin took time off from acting in the late 90s and early 2000s, but has since begun appearing again in television and film roles and independent films. Macaulay has been the subject of dozens of erroneous tabloid stories about his life over the years. The media just can't seem to grasp that he is a fairly normal adult who has chosen to live his life privately away from Hollywood and magazine front pages. Fellow actor and childhood friend <a href=# title="Seth Green Net Worth">Seth Green</a> is a frequent defender of Macaualay, aka Mac. In an interview on <a href=# title="Marc Maron Net Worth">Marc Maron</a>'s podcast, Green insisted that Mac simply does not care about what the news media says about him. Mac is apparently happy to live a life with millions of dollars in the bank away from the spotlight.</p><h2 id=macaulay-culkin-salary-per-movie><strong>Macaulay Culkin Salary Per Movie</strong></h2><p>For his first major movie, 1989's "Uncle Buck," Culkin made $40,000. One year later he shot into stardom thanks to "Home Alone," for which he was paid $100,000 but which made him a household name, and for the next four years he was a seven figure movie star.</p><p>In 1991 he made $1 million for "My Girl." In 1992 he earned $4.5 million to reprise his role in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York." Following this success he actually accepted a pay cut down to $1.5 million to appear in the 1993 thriller, "The Good Son."</p><p>Then, 1994 came, and with it the peak of Culkin's earning power as a movie star. First was the film "Getting Even with Dad," which earned him $8 million, a sum he earned again for the live action cartoon adaptation "Richie Rich."</p><p>Altogether, those seven films between 1989 and 1994 earned Culkin a total of $23.5 million, which with inflation is comparable to $40 million or so today.</p><ul><li>Uncle Buck (1989): $40 thousand</li><li>Home Alone (1990): $100 thousand</li><li>My Girl (1991): $1 million</li><li>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992): $4.5 million</li><li>The Good Son (1993): $1.5 million</li><li>Getting Even with Dad (1994): $8 million</li><li>Ri¢hie Ri¢h (1994): $8 million</li></ul><p><span><strong>Total: $23.5 million</strong></span></p><p>Earning $23.5 million between 1989 and 1994 is the same as earning $40 million today after adjusting for inflation.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-298963 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mm.jpg alt width=820 height=556 sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-298963 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Macaulay Carson Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in Manhattan, New York City. His father, Christopher Culkin, is a former Broadway actor. His mother, Patricia Brentrup, and his father never married. Macaulay was named after Thomas Babington Macaulay. Culkin is one of seven children and a few of his siblings are also actors. Culkin went to a Catholic school, St. Joseph's School of Yorkville, for five years before attending the Professional Children's School.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Macaulay Culkin began working in the entertainment industry at age four, taking parts in small theatre productions and made-for-TV movies, as well as small television and film roles. One of his still-memorable performances from this time was starring alongside <a href=# title="John Candy Net Worth">John Candy</a> in <a href=# title="John Hughes Net Worth">John Hughes</a>' film 1989 Uncle Buck.</p><p>Culkin's breakthrough came in 1990 when he was cast as Kevin McCallister in another John Hughes flick, Home Alone. Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Actor and he won an American Comedy Award and Young Artist Award. The following year, Culkin starred in a Saturday morning cartoon series called Wish Kid. He also hosted Saturday Night Live and made an appearance in Michael's Jackson's Black or White music video. Later in 1991 he starred opposite <a href=# title="Anna Chlumsky Net Worth">Anna Chlumsky</a> in My Girl. In 1992, Culkin was paid $4.5 million dollars to reprise his role of Kevin in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. To compare, he was only compensated $110,000 for the original Home Alone flick. Culkin turned to a darker role in 1993 when he starred as Henry in the drama-thriller The Good Son. He was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Villian for his role. Surprisingly, Culkin had also been a student at the School of American Ballet and starred in a filmed version of The Nutcracker. In 1994, after Culkin had a string of poor box office performers with Getting Even with Dad, The Pagemaster, and Richie Rich, he took a four-year hiatus from acting and attended a private high school in NYC.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-162181 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Macaulay-Culkin.jpg alt="Macaulay Culkin" width=500 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-162181 class=wp-caption-text>Jason Merritt/Getty Images</p><h2 id=after-acting-hiatus><strong>After Acting Hiatus</strong></h2><p>In 1998, Culkin made his return to acting when he appeared in a music video for Sonic Youth's "Sunday."

In 2003, Culkin returned to films with a dark role in Party Monster, in which he played drug user and murderer <a href=# title="Michael Alig Net Worth">Michael Alig</a>. The following year he had a supporting role in Saved! starring Jenna Malone and <a href=# title="Mandy Moore Net Worth">Mandy Moore</a>. The movie was a sleeper hit and Culkin got glowing reviews for his performance. He also did voice work in Seth Green's animated television show Robot Chicken. In 2006, Culkin published a semi-autobiographical novel, Junior, which discussed his stardom and his shaky relationship with his father. In the fall of 2007, Culkin starred in his first film since Saved!, dark comedy Sex and Breakfast. Up next, Culkin starred in a thirteen-episode NBC series, Kings. In 2011, Culkin was featured in <a href=# title="Adam Green Net Worth">Adam Green</a>'s experimental film The Wrong Ferarri. The film was shot completely on an iPhone. In December 2013, a video that Culkin co-produced and directed of himself eating a cheese pizza went viral on YouTube. The video was meant to be a parody of <a href=# title="Andy Warhol Net Worth">Andy Warhol</a> consuming a Burger King Whopper in the documentary 66 Scenes from America. It turned out to be a promotion for the debut of The Pizza Underground, his New York-based, pizza-themed comedy rock band. In May 2014, during a UK tour, he stormed off the stage during a performance with his band, during his own kazoo solo after fans started to boo and throw pints of beer on stage. They canceled the remainder of the UK shows. In 2016, Culkin announced The Pizza Underground was splitting up.</p><p>In 2019, Culkin had a part in Seth Green's film Changeland. It was announced in February 2020 that Culkin would be part of the cast of the upcoming tenth season of American Horror Story.</p><p>Culkin is the publisher and CEO of a satirical pop culture website and podcast, a parody of Goop, called Bunny Ears.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-274656 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1048469244.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-274656 class=wp-caption-text>VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images</p><h2 id=google-ad><strong>Google Ad</strong></h2><p>Following the break up with the band, Culkin produced web content and a podcast and has appeared in various TV ads. Most notable of the television ads was one for Google Assistant in 2018 where he reprised his role of Kevin from Home Alone and recreated scenes from the movie, with Kevin, obviously, being 28 years older than he was in the first film.</p><p>Macaulay was paid $1 million to appear in this commercial.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Mac was previously engaged to <a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> but they broke it off.

Built in 1935, the 4,879 square foot home includes five bedrooms and six bathrooms, and the .6-acre property features a swimming pool, a putting green, and a terrace with a fireplace and pergola.
