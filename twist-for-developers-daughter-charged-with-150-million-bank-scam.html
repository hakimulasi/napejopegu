daughter of fugitive property developer Jean Nassif intends to apply to have the charges against her thrown out after she was accused of a $150m bank scam.</p><p>Ashlyn Nassif is accused of falsifying documents to meet a $10.5m pre-sale condition for the Sky View apartments in Castle Hill in Sydney’s northwest.</p><p>Police allege the 29-year-old submitted fake contracts to Westpac Bank over three months in late 2021 to obtain a $150m loan to fund three of the five Skyview towers, or about 900 apartments.</p><p>The $900m apartment tower complex was being built by her father’s development company, Toplace. The company has since collapsed with outstanding debts of more than $1.24bn.</p><p>The lawyer has been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception and publishing false or misleading material after she allegedly submitted fake contracts to obtain a $150m bank loan.</p><p>On Wednesday, her lawyer Warwick Korn told Burwood Local Court there had been lengthy delays in proceeding with the matter.</p><p>“The brief was served almost three months ago,” he said.</p><p>“On the next adjournment we will be applying to discharge if something doesn’t move along.”</p><p>If Mr Korn makes the application and it succeeds, the charges against Ms Nassif would be dismissed.</p><p>He noted his client had endured lengthy delays and has been unable to work as a solicitor since she was arrested in February.</p><p>Crown prosecutor Hannah Purcell explained a further eight weeks was needed to “address the complexity” of Ms Nassif’s matter.</p><p>She told the court there were a dozen lever arch folders filled with material related to the allegations, including extensive financial records.</p><p>Magistrate Vivien Swain agreed to adjourn Ms Nassif’s matter until November due to “the complexity of the matter and the size of the brief”.</p><p>However, she emphasised there was “some urgency” to the proceedings because Ms Nassif was unable to work in the meantime.</p><p>“The crown is on notice,” Ms Swain warned.</p><p>At the time of the alleged multimillion dollar scam, Ms Nassif was a legal practitioner in the NSW Supreme Court and a partner at law firm EA Legal.</p><p>There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the firm, and Ms Nassif was suspended from practising law by the NSW Law Society after the charges were laid.</p><p>She could be reinstated, pending the outcome of the criminal charges laid against her.</p><p>The EA Legal office was one of four properties raided by police prior to Ms Nassif’s arrest earlier this year.</p><p>She was granted bail in May after her family deposited a $2.6m surety to ensure she would appear in court.</p><p>As part of her bail conditions, she is not permitted to contact dozens of people who are allegedly connected to the allegations against her, including her property developer father.</p><p>Ms Nassif is not charged as his daughter’s co-accused, but police have issued a warrant for his arrest over the same allegedly fraudulent $150m loan.</p><p>The embattled property developer is currently a fugitive and believed to be living in Lebanon.</p><p>His daughter’s legal battle comes two years after buyers were blocked from moving into the Skyview apartments.</p><p>Tenants were able to occupy their homes in 2021 after the NSW Building Commissioner found structural issues in the building.</p><p>NSW Fair Trading suspended Mr Nassif’s development licence for 10 years and cancelled the building licence of Toplace after they were found guilty of improper conduct.</p><p>The controversial developer fought the decision and was allowed to continue to operate under the condition the business does not accept any new contracts without permission.</p><p>However, the ban was reinstated in July and Toplace subsequently went into administration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGSwsMHRrapmpJGsfLXDyKyrZp6fp3qlsdWeo6iolafAbrDArp6hrJWneqS0wKuenpxdrLa1tIxqbGllnZ65rbXOp2SbmZ6gerSvwKZmp52nqHq0wM6rsGiekWt9p4HAcWdubJNmfqV%2Bj3FrnpxkaYZ2gpFwbWppZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jehane-thomas.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jehane Thomas</a>
